My scripts to configure and use various aspects of Azure. 

These scripts have been developed in different projects and I publish them here as examples 
on how to use Azure with various open source software stacks.

Some of the scripts are explained in blog posts in my msdn blog at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/holgerkenn/

The scripts in the iot folder are examples on how to build simple open-source based endpoint devices
for the internet of things. The azure website code they talk to can be found at https://github.com/glogemann/sensorbook

Please be aware that software, APIs and services change over time, these scripts worked when I checked them in,
but they may no longer work when you try them out. YMMV!
